LIHT
====
*Lazy Invoicing for Hackers without Time*

LIHT is a command line program that lets you parse your .ical files and extract time based work data from them, then output that information to invoices, reports, or whatever else you like. This allows you to define the hours you worked in a graphical calendar application (of your choice) and setup some general rules for different clients to greatly expediate your invoicing & accounting workflow.

It is designed for folks who bill hourly for there work and are who struggle to keep there accounting in order.

This new project is currently under active development and can be considered ALPHA release software. It might not work on your machine.

More to follow soon.
